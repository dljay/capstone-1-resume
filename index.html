    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <h3 class="indent-h2">Musician</h3>
    <p class="indent-h2">
      I am Jonghyuk Lee, a multi-talented artist with a fulfilling career in
      music. Throughout my journey, I have released numerous albums and
      established myself as a video game composer, collaborating with the
      industry giant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexon">Nexon</a>. My
      passion for music extends beyond performance. I am proud to be the author
      of the acclaimed book 'Behind the Score,' which delves into the creative
      process of video game music composition. I have also adapted this
      knowledge into a popular online course, enabling aspiring composers to
      benefit from my expertise.
    </p>
    <h3 class="indent-h2">Programmer</h3>
    <p class="indent-h2">
      Alongside my musical pursuits, I discovered a hidden passion for coding.
      What initially started as a recreational hobby has blossomed into a
      serious professional pursuit. I embarked on a journey of self-education,
      mastering C# and Unity to enhance my game development portfolio. My thirst
      for knowledge led me into the realm of mobile app development, where I
      honed my skills in Java and Kotlin. By 2024, I proudly launched two apps,
      Alarm Planet and Baby Stop, showcasing my programming prowess. Beyond
      mobile apps, I excel in front-end and back-end web development, with
      fluency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
